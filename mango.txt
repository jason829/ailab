weight:
    1. float value
        a. seed to meat ratio
        b. kilos
            i. if too small not suitable to sell whole
            ii. smaller mangos can be used for canned and other processes

density
    1. float
        a. can estimate seed to meat ratio

firmness:
    1. float
        a. test if off
            i. if too firm, not ripe enough, too soft == gone off, middle == just right
                b. thresholds, figure out later prob

aroma:
    1. float: 0-1 value
        a. certain particles in a certain volume of air
        b. more particles = more aroma?
            i. supplementary as big smell could equal good or bad
            ii. if lower smell == less ripen

3D imaging (volume estimation)
    1. float
        a. volume, can be used to measure density
            i. can estimate seed to meat ratio

image capturing
    1. percentage match - float
        a. good mango looks like this, bad mango looks like something else.

grading:
    1. unsuitable 
    2. selling whole
    3. canned sold
    4. useful for other

solution

grouped values of similar stuff:
1. weight + volume + firmness + (weight + volume = density) + aroma = 1 module
2. 3D imaging (volume estimation)

image capturing - see if it has mold (large brown spots, mold looking things) then discard from data

3D imaging feeds into 1 for density calc is to determine if sold whole or canned,

firmess, if ripe then canned food we want unripened mango for shops

determine position of hand (front facing, backfacing, side facing)
    how many fingers are up or down
    interlapping fingers2
    hand position (can see palm? or not? .....)
    index finger pointing in any direction? (other fingers are down compared to index)
